## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This app doesn't ship with it's own database. Instead, it users an external API request.  To bypass cross-origin request issues in the browser, a really (*really*) simple ExpressAPI handles this request for us. The API is offered by Data.Gov, so you'll need a working API key to make these requests work. 

Request Keys, Node environment settings, and the application port are all set in a `.env` file. Run

```
cp .envexample .env
```

to create your own .env file to store your keys. Then, replace the values as needed. The rest of these instructions assume you've left your port value at `9000` but, 

### Installing

First, install dependencies in your local environment.

```
npm i 
```

To run the API server, execute the command

```
npm run server
```

**Checkpoint!** Open Postman, or any other API testing environment, and navigate to `http:/localhost:9000/data`. You should get a JSON response.
